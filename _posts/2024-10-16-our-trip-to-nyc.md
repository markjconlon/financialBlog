## The Importance of Fun

In this day in age its easy to get super focussed on work, savings, investing and the stock market. I would be the first one to tell you that I fall into this category from time to time and its risky business. To draw a parallel to losing weight if you give up all the bad foods entirely it is very easy for the temptation to build and build and build then bam there goes the diet. Same thing with investing if you focus on saving in every little area always this could drive you towards a big reckless purchase.

Another thing to think about is quality of life. While I do really enjoy staying plugged in all the time and watching the numbers go up almost like building a character on an MMORPG. Unplugging and enjoying the finer things every once in awhile is invigorating. Luckily for me I have my wife to remind me of this and this year we decided to go big with a 5 day trip to New York last month.
