## My Moves
Made some big moves this month original intention was to reduce number of holdings but I ended up adding another one. 😅

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Sold
    - **EIT.UN** - closed the entire position, price wise it hasn't done anything over the last year or so and current yield is only at about 7.5%. I think at my young age its important for me to take more risks and shoot for higher returns
    - **PREF** - sold a little bit after a few down day trying to squeak out some more gains at the end of the year
  - Bought
    - **HXQ**
    - **HYLD**
    - **HDIV**
    - **VDY**
    - **HHIS** the new buy for me... I may double my current position in the new year
    - **GOOG**
  - Looking back I was indeed quite busy in the TFSA this month

- Bought
  - **VFV**

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- HDIV 0.180 -> 0.183
- HHIS 0.26 -> 0.27

## Fear and Greed Index
We have finally reached the fear side of the index and it has been that way for the last few weeks.

## Wrap Up
All in all it has been a bit of a flat month, fear and greed bordering on fear until the last week or so when we have risen up to neutral. Is the Santa Claus rally final here for the last two weeks of the year? We will see next week.
