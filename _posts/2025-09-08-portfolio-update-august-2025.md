## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Can't believe that's a wrap on August already. We're working on wrapping up a few projects at work before heading on a company retreat next week. Markets wise its been another month of straight green across the board. Some give and take but mostly up and too the right. Also its the first time in awhile I can't complain about **SCHD** underperforming its index, however there is still plenty of ground to make up

## My Moves
August represents the first month in awhile where I'm back to basics and simply adding to existing positions. No trimming this month!

One last callout is I have decided to just stick with the combined TFSA piechart instead of combined + breakdowns. I have been thinking about doing a total portfolio one as well... perhaps next month.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Bought
    - **AMD** with dividends
    - **VFV** with the normal contribution

### TFSA Breakdown

### RRSP Buys
Another month of adding to the spousal RRSP for my partner. This month I asked if she wanted to stick with the dividends or add a bit of growth. She chose more growth so I bought **VFV**. This marks the third holding in that Account. Which makes the account roughly
- 40% **QQCL**
- 40% **BANK**
- 20% **VFV**

Let's take a look into the breakdown of mine, note all changes are purely market related but I'm looking to add to my RRSP in September

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- I missed two small increases last month
  - **HYLD** 0.145 -> 0.147
  - **HDIV** 0.172 -> 0.173
- **CASH** appears to have found a consistent dividend at 0.106 for the last 3 months
- **XEI** decreased last month as well from 0.136 -> 0.112 which at least is still higher than when I first purchased shares

## Fear and Greed Index
Not much change here over the last month. Still sitting on the high end of neutral with the odd bounce into greedy territory over the month.

## Wrap Up
After another hot month one has to wonder how much longer this can keep going. I believe a fair amount will depend on the upcoming rate announcements for both US and Canada. They both report on September 17th which makes it even more interesting.
- Will the Bank of Canada start cutting again after pausing since March's last cut?
- Will the FED finally introduce their first rate cut.

Only time will tell. That's all for this months review thank you for reading!
