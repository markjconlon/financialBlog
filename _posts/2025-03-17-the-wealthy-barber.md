## Picking this book

Unfortunately there was no warm trip down south this time. I was simply exhausted from all of the videos and news around potential Tariffs as well as the other sad things that have happened over the last couple of weeks. I decided to go with another much talked about book in my financial circles. Mostly facebook groups but I have a few IRL friends interested in finances as well. Once again luckily for me it is available to Spotify Premium members so there's another subscription fee rationalization.

## My Thoughts

Starting out I can relate in many ways with the author. In terms of age when we seriously started investing, from small towns and come from a comfortable if not extravagant upbringing. Differences being the author has kids where I do not and I have always had the knack for saving money. 

In the second chapter the author travels back home and decides to bring up the topic of financial literacy and investing for the future with his father. His mother's immediate reaction is that something is wrong, which while understandable is somewhat unfortunate in that it is likely a common response. Financial literacy is not taught effectively if at all in your typical curriculum the onus is put on your parents.

Unfortunately the author's parents did not teach him financial literacy (I was lucky that my parents taught the basics outside of investing), but, at least he is starting now at age 28. Still plenty of time for the magic of compounding to occur. His father mentions that he is in luck, around 6 years ago he had the same inclination to get things in order and he found his knowledge in an unexpected place... the barbershop.

One good thing to note is that his father does mention having a solid pension plan which is a great thing. These days pension plans are mostly unheard of, or at least among my peers. So it is up to you to forge your own path and secure your future.

I really enjoy hearing another "average normal person" being wealthy story. Particularly when it is unbeknownst to the masses, so much so that the author (Dave's) friend Tom and sister Cathy do not believe it.

Cathy who runs her own business is assumed to be wealthy by her brother Dave to whom she responds not with ... and proceeds to rhyme off many expenses including her own tanning bed in her condo.

The body of the book lies in their Financial education, each month the three of them go down to the barbershop and learn the next of 12 steps.
Typically all is needed is the time it takes for both boys to get a haircut. At the end of the session they are given "homework" for lack of a better term to build on next time.

There is a lot of talk about US specific accounts which was interesting but since it was not applicable to me, I increased the playback speed over these sections.
  - It essentially boils down to determining what is the most advantageous account for one to contribute first and max that out as early as possible.

## Final Thoughts

All in all I really enjoyed this book and found it to be highly engaging, informative and even comical at times.

I was listening to the last chapter while shopping the other day and burst out laughing. I did receive at least one look that I saw but oh well I was enjoying myself.

Out of the three books I have read this far I believe this was the most enjoyable as it was a wholesome story and I would recommend it to anyone in their late teens and older.

During the ending credits two books were mentioned as potential followups to this one:
- The Truth About Money
  - By Ric Edelman
- The Warren Buffet Way
  - By Robert G. Hagstrom

If you've read either of the above books, or any of the three that I have read so far, I would love to hear your takes on them.
