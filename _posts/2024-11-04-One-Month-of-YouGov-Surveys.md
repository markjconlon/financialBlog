## What is it?
YouGov is a global market research and data analytics company that is headquartered in the UK with offices in several other companies.

Their mission is to supply a steady stream of accurate data and insight into what the world thinks.

One thing to be careful of with this type of thing is what is a scam and what is real. I can confirm that YouGov is not a scam and they do pay out rewards as I have collected from them twice now.

## Rewards

In order to get feedback and to collect data they offer many different rewards. Personally I have used the bank transfer and the amazon gift card so far and it was a painless experience.

Currently I am waiting until I have enough to cash out $50 for a bank transfer.

## How do you earn the rewards?
YouGov is mostly through simple surveys but sometimes there is followup a short period later that will give you bonus rewards. Personally I have just stick to the surveys even if I was invited to take things further. A recent one I was invited to offered a large point bonus but it required signing up for a non-free service which defeats the purpose for me.

Here's my breakdown for the month of October

| Date       | Time Spent      | Points   |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------- |
| 2024-10-02 | 2               | 250      |
| 2024-10-05 | 2               | 250      |
| 2024-10-08 | 8               | 750      |
| 2024-10-09 | did not qualify | 0        |
| 2024-10-10 | 4               | 250      |
| 2024-10-11 | 3               | 250      |
| 2024-10-13 | 2               | 250      |
| 2024-10-16 | did not qualify | 0        |
| 2024-10-19 | 16              | 1000     |
| 2024-10-20 | did not qualify | 0        |
| 2024-10-22 | 2               | 250      |
| 2024-10-24 | 9               | 750      |
| 2024-10-27 | 1               | 250      |
| **Total**  | **52 mins**     | **4250** |

Assuming I am going to convert at the $50 for 55000 points I spent 52 mins for approximately $4. So not something that you can quit your day job for but if you are sitting waiting for a bus or just killing time doing a quick survey on your phone isn't the worst way to spend your time.

One thing to note is that unlike some other survey sites such as Swagbucks there is rarely more than 1 survey every couple of days on YouGov. Speaking of Swagbucks I decided to see what spending the same amount of time there would get me.

## 52 minutes of Swagbucks

| **Estimated Time** | **Acutal Time (mins)** | **Qualified?**     | **Points** |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| 20                 | 2                      | No                 | 1          |
| 15                 | 2                      | No                 | 1          |
| 14                 | 1                      | No                 | 0          |
| 27                 | 1                      | No                 | 1          |
| 20                 | 7                      | No                 | 1          |
| 9                  | 3                      | No                 | 1          |
| 3                  | 3                      | No                 | 0          |
| 20                 | 11                     | Yes                | 75         |
| 10                 | 1                      | No                 | 0          |
| 10                 | 2                      | No                 | 0          |
| 13                 | 1                      | No                 | 0          |
| 4                  | 1                      | No                 | 0          |
| 3                  | 1                      | No                 | 0          |
| 30                 | 20                     | Yes                | 125        |
| **Totals**         | **56**                 | **No: 12, Yes: 2** | **205**    |

Using the $50 conversion to keep it similar with the YouGov calculation:
- $50 is 5000 SB, so I made $2.05 in 56minutes of work
- They do sometimes have sales and the current one is $50 for 3900 points
  - Even with the improved conversion rate $2.63 is still much worse than YouGov

I'm not going to lie I was pretty disappointed with the number of surveys that I started and did not qualify for. My profile is filled out so either they don't ask enough questions or they aren't pre-filtering the surveys.

The ones that are particularly annoying are those that take more than 5 minutes to tell you that you are not qualified for. One in the middle I spent 11 minutes before being told I was unqualified. Honestly I now remember what used to tick me off about Swagbucks surveys.

One nice thing they have is daily bonus points and really reward their consistent users.

## Summary 

Personally neither survey site is particularly worth it. I favour YouGov over Swagbucks as it is way more simplified and really low effort. If I was laid off or simply had more time on my hands perhaps I would really dive into Swagbucks.
