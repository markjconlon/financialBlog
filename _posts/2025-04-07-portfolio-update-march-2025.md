## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Well what can we say about the month of March besides we had a big old month of fear uncertainty and doubt. Unfortunately I believe there is a good chance of this happening next month as well, but, as you never know I just kept on buying!

Overall my ETFs were down slightly less than the indicies so thats something, VDY being the only one out of the bunch that was in the green.

  | **Ticker** | **Index**  | **2025-03-01** | **2025-03-31** | **Percentage Gain** |

## My Moves
March was a very busy month as I teased in [last weeks article](/posts/why-am-i-buying-google-and-amd). I made more or less the same amount of moves as I did in February. Looking forward to April I will likely have a few less before returning to normal in May.

Unfortunately my tax return has not come in yet but hopefully I will have that in a few weeks time and we can get it deployed!

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped **SPLT** as a part of us investing a portion of our joint account.
  - SOLD a little more **PREF** and rounded out my **AMD** position
  - BOUGHT:
    - **QQCL**
    - **GOOG**
    - **VDY**
  - Exited my AQN position and divided it between (in order of weight):
    - **PREF**, **GOOG**, **VDY**
    - I held onto this for far too long and it will always be my lesson learned. **49.5% loss**
  - Exited **UTES** -> **AMD**
    - I feel like I get adequate utilities exposure in VDY
  - Exited **HDIF** -> 2/3 **QQCL** and 1/3 **GOOG**
    - Honestly **HDIF** has been nice and steady flat price with 11% dividend, but, I am looking for a little bit more
      - **QQCL** with the higher payout % should replace the majority of the income and **GOOG** for growth!

I allocated a significant amount of my investable funds once again and have almost cleared my LoC used for **BANK**.

### TFSA Breakdown

  - *now featuring GOOG and AMD*
  - *the entirety of BANK was purchased with a line of credit offer. It has worked out well for me but it is risky to do this*
  - *SPLT is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

Positions I am thinking about consolidating are down to one at the moment:
  - **T** Still thinking of selling out of this one and increasing **XEI** and/or **BANK**

#### Breaking out each Account

### RRSP Buys

We finally decided to open a Spousal account for my wife. For its inaugural purchases we went with some **BANK** and **QQCL**. I do realize we have bought a fair amount of QQCL these past few months but I believe there is more upside than downside ahead. If I am incorrect... at least I have my tax return to come ðŸ˜….

I am not going to include the spousal in my RRSP chart for now so it is roughly the same as last month.

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- Nothing on this front which is completely fine after the busy couple of months we have had

## Fear and Greed Index
We are back in extreme fear and the AAII investor sentiment survey is also showing the most bearish we haver seen in awhile if not ever.
