Welcome back to the second last post for 2025. All in all it has been another great year work wise,  saving / investing wise and most importantly in our personal life!

## 2025 Achievements (in no particular order)
1. We are expecting our first child!! My personal life isn't something that I talk about much on her but this is something we have been working towards for awhile and is by far our biggest achievement of the year.

2. Wrote 51 blog posts this year and hit my goal of 25 long form videos if I've counted correctly this will be the 25th if not next weeks wil be 😆.

3. Savings Rate was shy of the target **33%** but still respectful at **31%**
  - For simplicity this only considers deposits into my TFSA / RRSP and Work RRSP. Any money kicking around in a bank account is not included.

4. Successfully negotiated a mortgage renewal from the low 6s to the low 4s and locked it in for 5 years. We also negotiated our mortgage

5. Spousal RRSP is rapidly growing and I am proud of it!


## Goals for 2026
Before I dive into the goals set out for next year I just want to call out that they have been scaled back over last year. The main reason is because this year I am becoming a father and I want to focus on that experience.

1. Maintain investing savings rate of 28%
  - I lowered this target this year because my wife will be off on maternity leave and I will need to contribute more to the weekly expenses. We do plan on opening an RESP and I will count the contributions towards that.

3. 24 blog posts. Essentially I would like to have 2 posts a month.
  - To me the monthly check-ins are the most important and will likely be half of the posts I make
    - I think I will combine the quarterly check-ins with these as well

4. 12 long form videos on YouTube.
  - I mostly plan on recording the monthlies in video blog form for this purpose. 

5. 50 short videos
  - These will likely be done sporadically with 1 big month of 1 short every day

6. 150 30minute workouts.
  - This is essentially 3 workouts a week. Over 2025 I did terribly in terms of fitness and I want to keep the same goal and hit it this year.

7.  Improve on the blog.
  - Another carry over from last year, at a high level I would like to:
    - Fix the light mode dark mode toggle
    - Beef up the about me.
    - Improve the back linking between the blog and youtube
    - Fine tune the ad placement and type
    - Learn more about SEO and implement it, perhaps adding a blog post about that.

8.  Learn the GO programming language.
  - I have used it a bit before but it has been awhile.
  - We use it a little bit a work currently but not enough to really dig into it.
  - I am going to start my journey signing up for boot.dev and completing their gameified trainings.

That's all for this week! I would like to wish you a Merry XMAS and Happy Holidays! 🎅 🎄
