## Reviewing The Market
The four major indicies were pretty much straight up this month with the low points coming in at the tail end of the first week. S&P lowest close of the month was September 6th 2024 and ended highest on the last day of the month. The big winner of the indices was the Nasdaq 100 and the biggest winner for my RRSP tickers was VTI by a very narrow margin. In the future I may look at counting dividends to give VDY and SCHD a fighting chance.
