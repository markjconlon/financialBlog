## Major Indices VS My RRSP

May brought us more stabilization in terms of fear uncertainty and doubt. The bullish percentage is 37.7% on the AAII sentiment survey meaning we are now back to historical average. Although to be fair there are fewer in the neutral category and more in the bearish category than the average. Important thing is that we are miles better than the last couple of months

## My Moves
While the last few months have seen more moves than typical for me the month of May was much more normalized. I spread out my buys in the TFSA and went back to my SDRSP as opposed to the spousal this month.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped one share of **CASH**
  - Bought in equalish parts:
    - **HYLD**
      - averaged this down a bit its been awhile since I have added here
    - **QQCL**
      - still trying to increase exposure to NASDAQ
    - **HXQ**
      - same as **QQCL** and still unsure which one I'd rather build up ðŸ˜…

### TFSA Breakdown

  - *CASH is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

Positions I am thinking about consolidating are down to one at the moment:
  - **T** Still thinking of selling out of this one and increasing **XEI** and/or **BANK**

#### Breaking out each Account

### RRSP Buys
As per usual in the months of May and November I typically add to my XAW position so its well ahead of the ex-dividend date since this is a semi-annual payer. This May was no different .. guess I'm predictable.

### RRSP Breakdown
![image](/assets/2025/2025-05-05-rrsp.PNG)
- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- Telus from $0.402 to $0.416 each quarter
- QQCL dipped to $0.275 last month but is back to $0.295 for May (paid in June)  

## Fear and Greed Index
Looking at the fear and greed index we are officially well into greed mode. I wonder if the saying sell in May and go away will hold true this year, only time will tell.
