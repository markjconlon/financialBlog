New year new me, well hopefully not too much of a new me portfolio wise. Although I have been off with the birth of our new born I am back to work today. It took about two weeks for us to hit our stride and for the remaining two weeks I definitely checked the portfolio a lot and made some changes. We will see those later. You may be thinking now that you have a newborn are you going to invest in an RESP and the answer is yes! We have opened a joint family RESP and will start contributing in the upcoming months.

## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Green market to start off the here across the board with the TSX60 leading the charge once again. Could the TSX60 come out on top for back to back years? I'm betting not but time will tell.

## My Moves
Made some big moves this month original intention was to reduce number of holdings but I ended up adding more. 😅
If I'm being honest I was a little all over the place with the TFSA

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - BOUGHT more **HHIS** with dividends
  - SOLD some **PREF** for more **HHIS**
  - BOUGHT
    - **GOOG** and **HHIS** with the dividends
  - Exited the **PREF** position opening a new position in META and I put the remainder into **CASH** as I'm tired of seeing **PREF** go down.
    - This may end up going into **META** but I didn't want to buy it all at once
  - With the market dropping into the end of the month I sold the excess **CASH** that I bought a few days prior and bought more **HHIS** and **META**

### RRSP Buys
Hey guess what we bought **VFV** in the spousal once again, but, to change things up we also picked up some **QQCL**. 

- Bought
  - **VFV** 2/3
  - **QQCL** 1/3

### RRSP Breakdown

### Spousal RRSP Breakdown

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
Only decreases this month. Thankfully nothing too major
- **QQCL** 0.315 -> 0.31
- **XEI** 0.114 -> 0.112

## Fear and Greed Index
Surprisingly even with all of the craziness to end the month south of the border, paired with the wild drop in silver and gold prices on Friday we are still sitting in the GREED section. It definitely feels like more pain ahead.

## Wrap Up
January was a wild month for us given us now being parents and once we got into the swing of things I definitely spent far too much time watching news and stock related youtube content. Getting back to work will be challenging but at least it will keep me away from the news! The last piece to call out is that I have increased the amount I am dollar cost averaging into **BTC**. I am still keeping it to only a few percent of my portfolio and buying it every two weeks. That's all for this week, take care!
