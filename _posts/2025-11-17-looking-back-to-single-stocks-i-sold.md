# ATD: Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc
Sold back in February 2025 and dumped the entirety into **VDY**

| Ticker  | Allocation | Gains Since Sale with Dividends |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **ATD** | 100%       | -1.56%                          |
| **VDY** | 100%       | 21.01%                          |

Definitely do not regret selling ATD if I recall correctly I was debating selling a few months earlier and watched it decrease in value at least 10% before finally pulling the trigger.

# AQN: Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp
Sold in March 2025 and split 45% PREF and 45% GOOG and 10% VDY

| Ticker   | Allocation | Gains Since Sale with Dividends |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **AQN**  | 100%       | 14.41%                          |
| **PREF** | 45%        | 6.01%                           |
| **GOOG** | 45%        | 70.30%                          |
| **VDY**  | 10%        | 24.21%                          |

Ah we meet again the anchor of my portfolio. This one should have been sold after the first dividend cut but alas you know the story I held onto it for way too long 😢. So obviously putting a big portion into **GOOG** was an incredible decision but, if we take that out of the picture and say I split it evenly into PREF and VDY I would still be ahead today. Glad this one is in my rear-view mirror

# T: Telus
Sold in June 2025 60% **XEI** and 40% **VFV**

| Ticker  | Allocation | Gains Since Sale with Dividends |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **T**   | 100%       | -3.97%                          |
| **XEI** | 60%        | 12.57%                          |
| **VFV** | 40%        | 16.97%                          |

I haven't really followed the Telecoms in a long while and I thought this one would be a little bit closer tbh. XEI is setup to drip and is a monthly payer so its gains are being slightly under reported. Either way a great decision. 

# TD: Toronto-Dominion Bank
Sold a portion in January 2025 and put it all in **BANK**

| Ticker   | Allocation | Gains Since Sale with Dividends |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **TD**   | 100%       | 44.39%                          |
| **BANK** | 100%       | 25.74%                          |

Good old TD Bank, now this one I thought about for a very long time and decided to start small with only selling 20% ish of my holdings. I had held it for so long at this point that yes even though **TD** has smashed **BANK** over the time period it did nothing for years. Fast forward to July I had watched TD BANK raise up about 25% since I sold in January and I decided to exit the position entirely.

| Ticker   | Allocation | Gains Since Sale with Dividends |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **TD**   | 100%       | 14.21%                          |
| **VFV**  | 80%        | 9.66%                           |
| **BANK** | 20%        | 14.73%                          |

Since July **TD** and **BANK** have risen at about the same rate. **BANK** I have setup to drip each month so the real result would be over 15% gains but being the smaller proceed I'm still slightly down on the trade. To be honest I was a tad worried about that but at least I am more diversified now. Also 2025 is the first year in a long while that the TSX has outstripped the S&P 500 so if we revert to the mean I'm sure we will be ahead.

# Wrap Up

Overall, I’m pleased with how these trades turned out. Position sizing is always an important lesson, in this case, my largest holding was **TD**, which made up about 45% of the total compared to the other three combined at 55%. Still, the final round of sales left me up 5.32% based on the sell-date values. I’ll take that as a solid win and a satisfying way to justify my moves 😆.
