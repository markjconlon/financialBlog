Hello all I just wanted to apologize for the lack of article last week and for my stocks I bought for November coming out slightly late. I was plagued with some health issues as well as it being an incredibly busy time of year at work and personally. With that being said let's dive in.

## Major Indices VS My RRSP
November brought us another big bull run in all four major indices with the biggest gaining coming from the Dow Jones industrial and the S&P being the lowest gainer this month. Long story short everything was a good buy at the start of the month.

In my RRSP VTI was the clear winner with the other 3 more or less even. This marks the third straight month where none of my holdings were down!

  | **Ticker** | **Index**  | **2024-11-01** | **2024-11-30** | **Percentage Gain** |
  | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |

  | .IXIC      | Nasdaq 100 | 18239.92       | 19403.95       | 6.38%               |
  | .DJI       | Dow Jones  | 42052.19       | 44782.00       | 6.49%               |
  | TX60       | TSX 60     | 1450.05        | 1537.09        | 6.00%               |

  | XAW        | Many Indexes     | 43.56          | 45.47          | 4.38%               |
  | SCHD       | Subset of Dow    | 28.10          | 29.34          | 4.41%               |

## My Moves
The month of November was a standard month investing wise for me. I'm still considering consolidating a few positions but that did not happen in November. Like always I bought in my TFSA during the first half of the month and RRSP in the latter half of the month

### TFSA BUYs & SELLs
  - Sold about 10% of our **SPLT** position to help spruce up our joint account to cover bills such as a triple mortgage payment this month
    - *Reminder in the graphic below it says joint as it is simply me investing a portion of our emergency fund cash* (do at your own risk)
  - Bought **VFV**
    - Still want to increase S&P and NASDAQ (specifically) tech exposure in my TFSA and believe we will continue to rally into December which turned out to be true
  - Bought **SPLT**
    - Manual DRIP since wealth simple currently only allows you to DRIP entire account but not individual stocks
  - Bought **QQCL**
    - by reinvesting all of the dividends from other holdings for the month

### TFSA Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value*
- *the entirety of BANK was purchased with a line of credit offer. It has worked out well for me but I would not recommend. I will re-evaluate in Feb 2025 when offer expires*
- *SPLT is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

Positions I am thinking about consolidating are:
  - **AQN** still bag holding here, may soon be time to cut my losses
  - **ETHY** it's been on a great run once it gets above $5 if it has a couple down days I may sell out
  - **T** Thinking of selling out of this one and opening a position in **UTES** and adding more to **BANK**
  - **TD** debating trimming this for more **BANK** if not selling out entirely

### RRSP BUYs

Another nice and simple month where I purchased **XAW**. Like last month I was definitely glad that it wasn't a month where I needed to exchange into USD. At time of writing google is showing **$1.43** CAD per USD meaning you'd likely pay closer to **$1.45** without the use of Norbert's Gambit.

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
**Note:** Many of my holdings are in ETFs that have varying distributions from one to the next so I'm not expecting that much dividend growth here. (also hopefully zero decreases but I'm still holding AQN)

I am hoping that our friends at Canoe (**EIT.UN**) will increase their distribution / dividend but not holding my breath

### Fear and Greed Index

That's all for this months review thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed my thoughts and progress as I plan on making this a recurring post here.
