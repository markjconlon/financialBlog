## Major Indices VS My RRSP
Well the majority of February was on an upwards trend, the last week sure turned that around! 

What little gain VTI had on the S&P 500 last month it gave up this month ðŸ˜¢.
- I'm still considering VOO over VTI.

Index wise TSX is the only index up and SCHD is the winner of my RRSP by a fair margin.

## My Moves
February was a very busy month as you may have gathered from my [article last week](/posts/reviewing-my-single-stocks).

It also marks Tax season here in Canada so I will be submitting our taxes and we are looking forward to a decent return once again. Mostly due to self directed RSP contributions.
- Unfortunately I sold a bit of crypto this year and will need to wait for them to open filing up for those with capital gains.
  - If the market continues to decline this will be a blessing in disguise. If not that's life I guess


### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped **SPLT** as a part of us investing a portion of our joint account.
  - I swapped **PSA** for **PREF**
    - If you recall a few months ago I switched **CASH** for **SPLT** which has been a fantastic choice, for diversification I decided to do **PSA** for **PREF** as **PSA**'s distributions have become quite small
  - Bought:
    - **VDY**
    - **QQCL**
  - Added slightly to **UTES**
  - Sold out of ATD and put the proceeds into **VDY**
  - At the end of the month I sold some **PREF** to buy **GOOG** and **AMD**
    - Some on February 26th and some on the 28th.
    - The main reason for these purchases is I feel both are simply out of favour and are extremely undervalued. I've seen and heard many folk comment on this so I decided to do something for the first time ever... I listened to both earnings calls.
      - For me moving forward any single stock I buy must either be really undervalued or having some kind of big advantage.
      - I also must listen to their earnings calls.

Once again I decided to allocate some of my investible funds to paying down the LoC used to buy **BANK**. Unfortunately my teaser rate has run out and I'm waiting for another ðŸ˜¢
- *Please note that BANK's dividend alone is more than enough to cover the revolving rate if I needed it.*

### TFSA Breakdown

- *I have decided to leave GOOG AMD and another small growth bet off of my chart this month*
- *percentages are calculated based on current market value*
- *the entirety of BANK was purchased with a line of credit offer. It has worked out well for me but it is risky to do this*
- *SPLT is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

Positions I am thinking about consolidating are:
  - **AQN** still bag holding here, may soon be time to cut my losses
  - **T** Thinking of selling out of this one and increasing **UTES** and adding more to **BANK**

#### Breaking out each Account

### RRSP Buys

This month I added to my XAW position to pull its weighting in advance of me liking buying a big chunk of SCHD in March.

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- Hamilton raised dividends for many of their ETFs including two in my portfolio
  - HYLD 	0.143 -> 0.145
  - HDIV 0.171 -> 0.172
- QQCL was raised from 0.25 to 0.295 up an incredible 18%
- Not necessarily a direct dividend increase or decrease but on March 21st 2025 SCHD will be reconstituting like they do every year
