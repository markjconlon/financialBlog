## My Moves


### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped **SPLT** as a part of us investing a portion of our joint account.
  - 

Once again I decided to allocate some of my investible funds to paying down the LoC used to buy BANK. Unfortunately my teaser rate has run out and I'm waiting for another ðŸ˜¢
- *Please note that BANK's dividend alone is more than enough to cover the revolving rate if I needed it.*

### TFSA Breakdown
![image]()
- *percentages are calculated based on current market value*
- *the entirety of BANK was purchased with a line of credit offer. It has worked out well for me but it is risky to do this*
- *SPLT is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

Positions I am thinking about consolidating are:
  - **AQN** still bag holding here, may soon be time to cut my losses
  - **T** Thinking of selling out of this one and increasing **UTES** and adding more to **BANK**

#### Breaking out each Account

### RRSP Buys

This month I kept it simple and did a small purchase into

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- Hamilton raised dividends for many of their ETFs including two in my portfolio
  - HYLD 	0.143 -> 0.145
  - HDIV 0.171 -> 0.172
- Not necessarily a direct dividend increase or decrease but on March 21st 2025 SCHD will be reconstituting like they do every year
  - I will post and update next month with my portfolio update
