It has been awhile since I have read a book. This is something my partner teases me about as she almost always has 2 or three on the go. I have two big drives coming up over the next month for a total of about 16 hours of driving. So what better way to pass the time than listen to an audiobook.

Once again I decided to ask Chat GPT for the **Top 10 Personal Finance Books That Actually Change Your Habits**. Until the summary the regular fonts is output from the AI and all of my comments will be in italics.

1. **Atomic Habits — James Clear**
    
    **Best for:** Building sustainable money habits that stick

    Not a money book, but the habit book. It’s a game-changer for anyone wanting to break spending cycles, automate savings, or finally stick to that investing plan. Clear’s “1% better” approach pairs perfectly with financial goals.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    - It shows you how small, consistent actions create long-term financial transformation.

    *This one I have heard of before and even know a few people that have read and recommend this book. It has a 4.32 / 5 rating on goodreads and the audio book is available on spotify. A definite contender.*

2. **The Psychology of Money — Morgan Housel**
    
    **Best for:** Understanding your emotional relationship with money

    Housel explains why smart people make irrational money decisions and how your upbringing, experiences, and biases shape your financial behaviour.

    *I have also heard of this book before. It has a 4.29 / 5 rating on goodreads and the audio book is available on spotify. A good option as well contender.*

    **Why it changes habits:**
    You start spending and investing based on values, not impulse—or comparison.

3. **Your Money or Your Life — Vicki Robin & Joe Dominguez**

    **Best for:** Breaking out of the work–spend cycle

    This book reframes money as life energy, helping you see the true cost of your habits.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    It forces you to track spending with intention—and often leads to major lifestyle shifts.

    *I have not heard of this book before. It has a 3.99 / 5 rating on goodreads and the audio book is available on spotify. The why speaks to me as if they are my own words. I have written many posts on that topic.*

4. **The Millionaire Next Door — Thomas J. Stanley & William D. Danko**

    **Best for:** Understanding how everyday people quietly build wealth

    This book destroys the myth that wealth is flashy. Most millionaires live below their means and invest consistently.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    You start valuing long-term freedom over short-term status.

    *This one I have read before and I even have a [blog post](/posts/the-millionaire-next-door/) about it*

5. **I Will Teach You to Be Rich — Ramit Sethi**

    **Best for:** Practical scripts, automations, and confidence with money

    A modern classic, Ramit combines behavioural psychology with step-by-step tactical advice.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    He gives you concrete action plans—what to say to your bank, how to automate savings, how to negotiate bills.

    *I have not heard of this book before. It has a 4.20 / 5 rating on goodreads. The audio book is not available on spotify only a summary. So this book is likely out out the race.*

6. **The Simple Path to Wealth — JL Collins**

    **Best for:** New and intermediate investors

    Straightforward, stress-free investing advice built around index funds—ideal for anyone overwhelmed by choices.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    You stop trying to pick stocks and start focusing on consistent, long-term investing.

    *I have not heard of this book before. It has a 4.42 / 5 rating on goodreads although only 30k reviews. The audio book is available on spotify. I definitely lean towards index investing but I do enjoy a small amount of single stocks.*

7. **Rich Dad Poor Dad — Robert Kiyosaki**

    **Best for:** Challenging traditional ideas about money and work

    Love it or hate it, this book forces you to rethink assets, liabilities, and financial independence.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    You start looking for opportunities to grow wealth instead of just earning income.

    *This one I have read before and listened to the audiobook at least twice. Spotify has the audiobook and it is a 4.1 / 5 on goodreads.*

8. **The Richest Man in Babylon — George S. Clason**

    **Best for:** Timeless financial wisdom in story form

    Its simple parables cover saving, investing, patience, and discipline better than most modern books.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    Stories stick—making the principles easy to apply to your everyday life.

    *I have heard of this book before. It has a 4.23 / 5 rating on goodreads. The audio book is available on spotify. I do generally like sticky stories so it looks like a great option*

9. **Quit Like a Millionaire — Kristy Shen & Bryce Leung**

    **Best for:** Canadians and real-world financial independence seekers

    From a Canadian tech worker to retiree in her 30s, this book blends math, mindset, and practical FI strategy.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    It reveals how small optimization decisions add up to decades of freedom.

    *I have not heard of this book before. It has a 4.22 / 5 rating on goodreads, albeit only 7k reviews. The audio book is available on spotify. I do identify as a Canadian in tech and I am very interested in the FIRE movement so I will be seriously considering this one.*

10. **The Barefoot Investor — Scott Pape**

    **Best for:** Simple, step-by-step money organization

    A friendly, no-BS guide for setting up buckets, automations, and financial routines that actually work.

    **Why it changes habits:**
    It gives you a clear, repeatable system instead of vague advice.

    *I have not heard of this book before. It has a 4.37 / 5 rating on goodreads. Unfortunately the book only has a summary available on spotify so it will not be a contender for now.*

## Summary

After reviewing the list and reflecting on which titles I’ve already read (only 2 😢), a few clear standouts emerged as great candidates for my upcoming drives. **Your Money or Your Life** immediately caught my attention because its philosophy around money as “life energy” aligns closely with themes I’ve written about, and the fact that it's new to me makes it even more compelling. I’m also choosing **Quit Like a Millionaire**, since its Canadian FIRE perspective fits my background perfectly and seems especially relevant as someone in tech looking to optimize for financial independence.

I will note that for me voice of the narrator is a huge deal so we will see how that goes as well. I'm definitely not against pivoting to another of these great options. Combined they total for about 20 hours of audio so I'll be using at least a 1.25x speed to wrap em up. Finally I will definitely be writing a blog post on each to round out the year 🙌
