## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Outside of a few days particularly towards the end of July we were up and to the right again and bouncing between greed and extreme greed. The Dow Jones continues to underperform showing that we are still not it an everything bull market. I am curious if we will get there. Only time will tell.

## My Moves
- Well I ended up making many moves this month in an effort to streamline my portfolio. I sold out of my **TD** and **GDV** positions with the breakdowns below. On the RRSP side I contributed to the spousal account as I continue to build that out for my partner.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - I previously have been rounding up and manually dripping 1 share of CASH, I now have $50 auto deposited into a HISA instead. Main idea is that I want the TFSA to one day be maxed with growing assets. Moving forward I will not be calling this out.
  - Bought
    - **AMD** with dividends
    - **VFV** with the normal contribution
  - SOLD **GDV**
    - 40% **AMD**
    - 40% **HXQ**
    - 20% **GOOG**
  - SOLD **TD**
    - 70% **VFV**
    - 30% **BANK**

### TFSA Breakdown

So I know last month I said that I had liquidated everything that I had been seriously considering except maybe **GDV** and **HYLD**. Obviously that was not the case as I ended up selling all of my **TD** and **GDV**. For the latter I finally hit break even on stock price and it was time to move on from my last Split Share fund. As for the former I was finally up about 25% after holding through all of the pain and decided to diversify

#### Breaking out each Account

### RRSP Buys
I kept it simple this month and split the contribution in half and allocated to **QQCL** and **BANK** which remain the only two holdings in the spousal account. Below is my rrsp account which is the same as month aside from price changes over the course of the month.

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
-  Nothing of interest again this month.

## Fear and Greed Index
Looking at the fear and greed index we cycled back to neutral on the final day after a month filled with greed bordering on extreme greed.
