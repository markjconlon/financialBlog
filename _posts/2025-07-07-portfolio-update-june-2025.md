## Major Indices VS My RRSP

June has been another month of up and to the right. Sure there was the odd speed bump in there but overall it has been fantastic. **VDY** outperformed the **TSX60** likely do to the crazy performance of **TD** over the last couple of months. Glad I didn't sell my entire position a few months back. **SCHD** continues to disappoint, hopefully it will start to turn around.

AAII sentiment survey has us up to 45% bullish and 33% bearish. This is quite a change from back in April when we where 62% bullish. In terms of rate cuts I feel like both BoC and the FED are going to hold until September.

## My Moves
Biggest news is I decided to liquidate my entire **Telus** position at the beginning of June other than that I did typical buys in my TFSA and a larger than normal buy in my RRSP after the dividends from **XAW**, **VTI** and **SCHD** came in.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped one share of **CASH**
  - Sold **Telus** and allocated
    - 3/5ths into **XEI**
    - 2/5ths into **VFV**
  - Sold **ACT**
    - This was a small moonshot position I decided to cash out while I was up about 85%
    - Dumped it all into **QQCL**
  - Bought
    - mostly **HXQ**
    - and small amounts of **GOOG** and **AMD**

### TFSA Breakdown

I have liquidated or trimmed all positions that I have been seriously considering. There is always potential in the future for more but I think I will let my current positions stand.

I have briefly thought about selling all of my **GDV** and potentially **HYLD** but nothing serious yet.

I've also been thinking about focusing more on indexes moving forward, not sure if I'd liquidate the covered call ETFs or maybe just turn drip on and deploy new cash to indexes.

### RRSP Buys
I had to really scrape the bottom of the barrel to be able to afford the amount of shares I wanted in **VTI** this month. What a rally we have had. Some may say I should have waited or bought less sense we have rallied but I am sticking to my plan and continuing to believe in Dollar Cost Averaging.

### RRSP Breakdown

- *percentages are calculated based on current market value, USD is converted to CAD based on google finance rate*

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
-  Nothing of interest this month

## Fear and Greed Index
Looking at the fear and greed index we are pushing into extreme greed. I wonder how long this can hold... only time will tell.
