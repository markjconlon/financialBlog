## My Moves
Biggest news is I decided to liquidate my entire **Telus** position at the beginning of June other than that I did typical buys in my TFSA and a larger than normal buy in my RRSP after the dividends from **XAW**, **VTI** and **SCHD** came in.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Manually dripped one share of **CASH**
  - Sold **Telus** and sent
    - 3/5ths into **XEI**
    - 2/5ths into **VFV**
  - Sold **ACT**
    - This was a small moonshot position I decided to cash out while I was up 85%
    - Dumped it all into **QQCL**
  - Bought TBD

### TFSA Breakdown

  - *CASH is my wife and I's joint emergency fund.*

I have liquidated or trimmed all positions that I have been thinking about. There is potential in the future for more but

## Fear and Greed Index
Looking at the fear and greed index we are officially well into greed mode. I wonder if the saying sell in May and go away will hold true this year, only time will tell.
