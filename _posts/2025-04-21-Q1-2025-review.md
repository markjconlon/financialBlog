## 10 Goal Check-in
For a full description please refer back to my [Looking Forward to 2025 Post](/posts/looking-forward-to-2025)

1. Maintain investing savings rate of 33% üìà
  - My contributions divided by my gross pay is currently 19.6%. It would be well over if there wasn't a delay in my tax return but thats ok.

2. Open spousal RRSP ‚úÖ
  - üéâthis is big for us as it makes sense mathematically and even more importantly makes my partner happy!

3. 50 blog posts. üìà

4. 25 long form videos on YouTube. Or essentially 2 a month. üìà
  - 8/25 I definitely started the year off strong and have been recording less recently

5. 50 short videos ‚ùå
  - I have not made a single short video this year

6. Negotiate our bundled home and car insurance. üìà
  - Car Insurance we called signed up for the driving app and did everything we could to reduce the cost, confirmed bundling etc.
    - Could still shop around
  - Home Insurance call scheduled looking like pre negotiation its almost up 50% year over year which is wild

7. Negotiate our mortgage renewal. üìà
  - It's that time of year again, the bank has reached out and the numbers are decent but we will still look to play the match game 

8. 150 30 minute workouts. ‚ùå
  - 29 recorded sessions some of which were shorter walking sessions

9.  Improve on the blog. ‚ùå
  - While I have been producing quality content on the blog I haven't invested much time in the blog itself 

10. Introduce quarterly check-in posts with videos seeing how closely I am tracking my goals set for the year. üìà

## Portfolio Performance Review

Overall we are definitely up less percentage wise for all time than we were back on New Years Day.
  - Value wise my portfolio is currently down **1.69%** YTD
  - Removing deposits over Q1 it is down **10.43%** YTD
  - By comparison:
    - Nasdaq is down **13.26%**
    - S&P is down **8.61%**
    - TSX is down **4.96%**

One big callout is that a significant portion of my portfolio is in USD and for these quarterly performance calculations I like to convert the USD to CAD. For the day to day or week to week I usually leave the conversion out for simplicity.
  - At the start of the year my recorded conversion rate was **1.4407** and today for end of Q1 it is **1.3902**

## Wrap Up

Goal wise I definitely have some work to do but it is definitely possible to still hit all of my goals. Improving on the blog and increasing the physical activity will needing the most work. Short form content I'm not worried about as I will likely get the bug at some point and blast through them.

Portfolio wise I am doing slightly worse than the S&P500. I have made a ton of changes to the portfolio over the last couple of months so it will be more interesting at the mid year mark to end Q2. Let's hope my changes are for the better. Full disclosure I believe they will be, but, it will not surprise me if it takes a couple of quarters to pay off.
