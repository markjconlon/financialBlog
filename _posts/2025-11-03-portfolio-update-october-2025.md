October has come and gone and so has Halloween, market wise it was far from a scary one. I guess it could be scary if you are in the bubble camp I however am not. We had a record 110 trick or treaters just last night and it was great to see all of the costumes on the little ones and so many Blue Jays jerseys on the parents. Game 7 is tonight, I can't wait and am really hoping for a Jays victory.

## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Market wise October was another green month which marks I don't know how many in a row now likely all the way back to April which is wild to think about. SCHD was the only ticker that was down once again, I'm going to continue to wait and see on this but every month it feels like I should just exit and throw it all into VTI.

## My Moves
Made a few purchases in the TFSA this month and one buy in the RRSP as follows:

    - **HXQ** with dividends
    - **PREF** with dividends as well
    - **VFV** with the normal contribution

### RRSP Buys
We sticked on the Canadian side of the border this month and went with **VDY** for a slightly smaller buy than normal this month. Will likely return to spousal purchase next month!

- Bought
  - **VDY** with a combination of dividends and monthly contribution

## Fear and Greed Index
We have finally reached the fear side of the index and it has been that way for the last few weeks.

## Wrap Up
All in all it was another great month for the market definitely starting to have some signs of fear with wild swings up one day and down the next. Being deep into the earnings season we have seen companies on both sides and will have to wait and see what the consensus is over the next few months.
