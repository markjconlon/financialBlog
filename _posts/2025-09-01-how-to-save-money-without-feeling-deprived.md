When people think about saving money, they often imagine cutting out all the fun in life. But, the truth is saving doesn’t have to feel like punishment. With a few intentional choices, you can build financial security while still enjoying most of the things you love. Now I say most here as I believe many have a few expensive habits that may have to change at least slightly even if its the frequency of said habit. 

Looking at a simple example if I like to eat out every week maybe we switch that to every other week. This is a reduction of 50% meaning a large change. A smaller change yet impactful change is limiting myself to a single beer at the restaurant and drinking water as well. The smaller change still allows for the same frequency of nights out but saving you $20 a week or more depending on the number of drinks.

That $20 a week compounded at 8% quarterly will become $200k over 35 years or what many would consider enough to allow you to retire 2 years earlier.

# Focus on the Big Wins

The best place to start with the areas that have the greatest impact on your budget. Addressing one of these high impact areas can have equal or greater effect then a handful of small items. The big wins to start with are in housing, transportation, and food. Could you refinance or downsize your living space? Consider using public transit, carpooling, or even driving a fuel-efficient used car instead of financing something new. For food, meal planning and cooking at home more often can save hundreds each month compared to constant takeout or going out to a restaurant. Depending on where you live another great option is picking up prepared food or ready to cook from your local grocery store. This is something we have done a fair amount recently instead of going to a restaurant.

Transportation wise delaying purchasing a car is the one of the best financial decisions I have made in my life. I bought my first car after university for $2000 and it was a 15 year old sedan. When I moved to Toronto and no longer needed a car I sold it saving on upkeep, parking and insurance. My partner and I now have a car but honestly it is an expensive convenience at the moment and not necessary. The difference is when we were starting out our financial journey we did not have this expense or better put an absolute anchor being car expenses.

Home wise not getting more than you actually need is probably the most basic and yet important piece of advice. If you own your home negotiating and shopping around is extremely important for everything especially the mortgage.

But doing the same for insurance, appliances and other medium to large or recurring purchases is almost just as important.

# Celebrate the Small Victories

The little decisions add up, too. Buying store-brand (no-name) products often means the same quality at a fraction of the price. Next time you’re at a restaurant, skip the soda or cocktail and order water, it’s healthier and free. Even bringing your own coffee and leaving a trip to the café as a treat can quietly put extra dollars back in your pocket. Each of these small choices might seem minor, but combined over weeks and months, they become a powerful savings tool. 

Luckily I primarily work from home and don't have the temptation to eat out for lunch everyday but my partner does have to go into the office 5 days a week. She often takes a salad kit from the grocery store which we buy 3-4 each week as we grocery shop. Now it would be even more economical to buy ingredients and make it from scratch but that would mean less variety and more effort. So we make a compromise here and thats what it is all about!

# Wrap Up

Saving money doesn’t mean saying “no” to everything—it’s about saying “yes” to what matters most. By tackling the big expenses wisely and sprinkling in small, everyday wins, you can build a solid financial future without feeling deprived. Remember: it’s not about cutting joy out of your life, it’s about creating more freedom and choices down the road.
