## Earnings
The average weekly year over year earnings were up **4.6%** to **$1,270** in the month of August 2024.

Month over month there was little chance with this number being only 0.9% higher than July.

Average weekly hours worked came in at 33.5

Converting the weekly number into a salary we are looking at an average salary of **$66,040**. Personally I would like to see median numbers as well to get a more complete picture but they did not have this data.

Those who owned their principle residence had a median net worth of **$457,100**.

While those without a principle residence has seen the median increase to **$44,000**.

Lowest group was the same as the older generation being those who do not have a principle residence and who also do not have a employer-sponsored pension plan. That groups median came in at **$27,000**.

A higher percentage of young families have opted to rent and attempt to amass wealth while renting. Among these renters, of those who also did not have a employer-sponsored pension plan, 15% had a net worth greater than **$150,000**
- members of this group commonly held assets in

#### Summary
Before I invite you to do the perfectly natural human nature thing of comparing yourself to your neighbours I want to point you in the direction of the percentage column. In all cases roughly half of Canadians even have a TFSA and only 2/3 have an RRSP. So if you have both of those give yourself a pat on the back. Now take a look at the median value and in my mind their are two outcomes.
 1) If you are above the median keep it up and stick to your plan!
 2) If you are below the median it simply means you have work to do. Maybe that involves looking to increase your income but the easier option is usually look at your spending habits and introduce a budget. (Yeah I know here Mark is talking about budgets again but hey they work)

Last thing I would like to bring up is that across the board the TFSA shows less usage. Personally I think the weighting should be flipped or at least equal. The simplest explanation for this is that we found out the average income for 2023 of **$66,040** with the median is likely far lower than that. The RRSP's advantage is in deferring tax until a later date, however, with the lowest tax bracket going all the way up to **$53,359** in 2023 why defer at the lowest bracket where the majority of your income is. In my mind the best play would be to focus on TFSA first at these income levels.

If you are really set on sticking with the RRSP then I would consider contributing no more than what is in your highest bracket. To look at an example
  - $55,000 salary
  - 55,000 - 53,359 = $1641.00 to RRSP at most with the rest of savings invested in the TFSA

## Housing Sentiment
While looking for the net worth and TFSA vs RRSP breakdowns I scrolled past many housing related surveys and found the following somewhat shocking information. The only reason I'm saying somewhat shocking is I have heard a similar story in the news recently but it hits different when you see the raw data. And without further ado:

Nearly half (45%) of Canadians report that they are very concerned about housing affordability because of the cost of rising costs of housing or rent. In 2022 more than 1 in 5 Canadians reported that they spend more than 30% of their income on shelter costs. Fast forward to surveys conducted more recently (August 2nd to September 15th 2024) it is now 45%.

Age definitely plays a factor here and over that same survey period young adults, those aged 20 to 35 years, reported 59 being very concerned about their ability to afford housing. 51% had moving plans that were impacted by rising prices.

For adults above the age of 35, 38% reported being very concerned with 25% having their moving plans impacted.

Breaking this down provincially Ontario closely followed by British Columbia had the highest percentage reporting difficulties. Unfortunately as a resident of Toronto I am not surprised one bit.

In this survey, people who reported experiencing 1+ housing challenges recorded lower results on indicators for overall well-being. Of those reporting at least one housing challenge only 36% reported high satisfaction in life, compared to 70% for those without housing challenges.
