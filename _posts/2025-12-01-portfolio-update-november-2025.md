As December is upon us today I am wondering if Santa will come this year. November was relatively flat overall with a small pullback in the middle of the month before rallying into the end. Many "financial experts" have recently mentioned it will all come down to what the FED does here next week. Before then we would like to see BTC to continue to rally although if history repeats itself it should go down for the next year.

## Major Indices VS My RRSP

Indices looking pretty flat aside from the TSX once again. What a rocket ship we have been on here north of the border. As someone who hold a fair amount of domestic ETFs you love to see it. SCHD smashed the Dow Jones this month, could it be finally pivoting towards out performance? 🤞

## My Moves
During the dip this month I ended up making a few extra moves. I wanted to make more but I held off, well sort of. My partners TFSA saw some action this month as well. Some through deposits and some through closing all covered call positions which were relatively small. Trimming my covered call positions in my TFSA is something I have thought about recently, but, I decided to start in my partners as they are smaller positions.

### Partners TFSA
  - Bought
    - ZSP
    - ZNQ
    - VDY
  - Exited
    - EIT.UN
    - HYLD

### My TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Bought
    - **HXQ** with dividends
    - **AMD** with dividends as well
    - **VFV** with the normal contribution
  - Sold
    - **PREF** -> **AMD** buying the dip baby!

### RRSP Buys
This month we went back to the spousal RRSP and stuck with VFV. Starting to feel like all I have done lately is buy VFV or VDY 😆. I have also turned on DRIP in my RRSP as I will be focussing on the spousal RRSP.

- Bought
  - **VFV**

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
After a big month in terms of dividend increases this month is pretty quiet.

As for decreases PSA and CASH plus I'm assuming every other HISA ETF continue to pay out less and less each month. As much as I would like to switch those to something else I continue to tell myself, hold on that is emergency fund money!

## Fear and Greed Index
We are still sitting in fear / extreme fear and will likely stay that way over the next few weeks if I were to guess. That's ok as we always be buying!

## Wrap Up
Taking a snap shot at the first and the end of the month we mostly had a flat month. Definitely some ups and downs but with the fear in the market it was status quo. Heading into the end of the year I will keep up with the normal buys but I won't be adding any extra in. I should qualify that with unless we get a wild swing down during the month of December!
