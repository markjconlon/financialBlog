## 10 Goal Check-in
For a full description please refer back to my [Looking Forward to 2025 Post](/posts/looking-forward-to-2025)

1. Maintain investing savings rate of 33% ✅
  - My contributions divided by my gross pay is currently 33.85%. This is obviously propped up by Tax Returns

2. Open spousal RRSP ✅
  - 🎉this is big for us as it makes sense mathematically and even more importantly makes my partner happy!

3. 50 blog posts. 📈
  - tracking really well as I haven't missed one yet 😄 

4. 25 long form videos on YouTube. Or essentially 2 a month. 📈
  - 14/25 Videos have continued to slow down but I should be able to hit the target. I definitely have less passion for recording

5. 50 short videos ❌
  - I still have not made a single short video this year

6. Negotiate our bundled home and car insurance. ✅
  - Negotiated with our current broker upped the deductible slightly as well, unfortunately rates are way higher for everyone this year.

7. Negotiate our mortgage renewal. ✅
  - Signed on for a 5 year fixed interest rate got a match and a beat with our current broker and am very happy with that 

8. 150 30 minute workouts. 📈
  - 61 recorded sessions some of which were shorter walking sessions. I recently signed up for a 1 year subscription of the BetterMe app and am looking forward to being motivated through there

9.  Improve on the blog. ❌
  - Still nothing here, unlikely to happen until August or maybe the fall 

10. Introduce quarterly check-in posts with videos seeing how closely I am tracking my goals set for the year. 📈
  - Second checkin complete

## Portfolio Performance Review

Note I noticed that I missed a deposit when calculating my portfolio returns in Q1 so I ended up being slightly worse than the S&P 500.

Halfway through the year we are looking more solid than the Q1 mark
  - Value wise my portfolio is currently up **14.12%** YTD
  - Removing deposits over Q2 it is down **11.36%** YTD
  - By comparison:
    - Nasdaq is up **8.62%**
    - S&P is up **6.67%**
    - TSX is up **7.64%**

One big callout is that a significant portion of my portfolio is in USD and for these quarterly performance calculations I like to convert the USD to CAD. For the day to day or week to week I usually leave the conversion out for simplicity.
  - At the start of the year my recorded conversion rate was **1.4407** and today for end of Q2 it is **1.3686**


### Full Year

| Category                   | Q1          | Q2         | Q3  | Q4  |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio With Deposits    | **-1.69%**  | **14.12%** | -   | -   |
| Portfolio without Deposits | **-10.43%** | **11.36%** | -   | -   |
| Nasdaq                     | **-13.26%** | **8.62%**  | -   | -   |
| S&P 500                    | **-8.61%**  | **6.67%**  | -   | -   |
| TSX 60                     | **-4.96%**  | **7.64%**  | -   | -   |


## Wrap Up

Goal wise I have made some incredible progress and am not worried at all about hitting all 10 by the end of the year.

Portfolio wise I am doing better than the S&P 500 which is my main goal. Some of my moonshot bets have definitely paid off and I do have a lot of exposure to Canadian equities which have outperformed the S&P 500 as well. I am very curious to see if I will still be ahead come Q3 and maybe just maybe by years end.
