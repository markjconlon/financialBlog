## 10 Goal Check-in
For a full description please refer back to my [Looking Forward to 2025 Post](/posts/looking-forward-to-2025)

1. Maintain investing savings rate of 33% 📈
  - My contributions divided by my gross pay is currently 31.11%. Halfway through the year was propped up by tax returns even though I had a large 

2. Open spousal RRSP ✅
  - 🎉this is big for us as it makes sense mathematically and even more importantly makes my partner happy!

3. 50 blog posts. 📈
  - So I did miss one post back in August but still tracking well 

4. 25 long form videos on YouTube. Or essentially 2 a month. 📈
  - 20/25 Videos counting the video to accompany this blog post so this should be easy to hit. October and November portfolio and I may do December's slash year in review in late December which would mean I only need one other video.

5. 50 short videos ❌
  - No change here beginning to look highly unlikely that this will happen

6. Negotiate our bundled home and car insurance. ✅
  - Negotiated with our current broker upped the deductible slightly as well, unfortunately rates are way higher for everyone this year.

7. Negotiate our mortgage renewal. ✅
  - Signed on for a 5 year fixed interest rate got a match and a beat with our current broker and am very happy with that 

8. 150 30 minute workouts. ❌
  - 72 recorded sessions I definitely remember missing the recording of a few but either way I will not be able to hit this unless I start doing like 8 workouts a week so this is going to be a miss.

9.  Improve on the blog. ❌
  - Still nothing here, unlikely to happen until maybe November at this point

10. Introduce quarterly check-in posts with videos seeing how closely I am tracking my goals set for the year. 📈
  - Third check-in complete 🎉

## Portfolio Performance Review
3/4 through the year we are looking more solid than ever
  - Value wise my portfolio is currently up **25.19%** YTD
  - Removing deposits over Q3 it is up **22.51%** YTD
  - By comparison:
    - Nasdaq is up **18.22%**
    - S&P is up **14.48%**
    - TSX is up **20.65%**

One big callout is that a significant portion of my portfolio is in USD and for these quarterly performance calculations I like to convert the USD to CAD. For the day to day or week to week I usually leave the conversion out for simplicity.
  - At the start of the year my recorded conversion rate was **1.4407** and today for end of Q3 it is **1.3951**

## Wrap Up

Goal wise we have definitely slipped a bit and am planning on buckling down to get 8 or 9 out of 10 complete

Portfolio wise I am still doing better than the S&P 500 which is my main goal. Moonshot bets continue to be paying off and I do have a lot of exposure to Canadian equities which have outperformed YTD. It's looking like the Canadian market may end up beating the US for the first time in awhile we will have to wait and see come December.
