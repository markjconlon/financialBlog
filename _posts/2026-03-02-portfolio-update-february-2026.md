Second month down and the first month I have been back to work. It has been more challenging for sure to stay focussed between balancing a newborn, watching the wild swings in the market and dialing in for work. Perhaps I should be ignoring the wild swings and remove my single stocks like the majority of my friends. In actuality I picked up another single stock 😅.

## Major Indices VS My RRSP

The indices across the board are all slightly down since the beginning of the month... oh wait amount look at us go up here north of the border with the TSX60 up just over a half percent. I'm feeling like a broken record here but really how long can we keep this up? Was last month just a bump in the road?

## My Moves
As I eluded to earlier this turned into a bit of a busy month trading wise for me. Part of me wants to hold back some cash in case we experience a big dip but not too much as I still believe in DCA, always be invested because time in the market beats timing the market.

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Started off with **BUY**s in:
    - **HHIS**, **META** and added a bit to **CASH**
    - I also rounded out my positions in **GOOG** and **AMD** with small buys
  - Finally decided to exit **HYLD** for a small ~2% gain on stock price although I have years of dividends on top of that:
    - BUY **CASH** with the majority until I decided what to do with it
    - BUY equalish portions of **HHIS**, **HXQ**, **GOOG**, **META**
      - okay maybe now I have actually rounded out my position in **GOOG** 😅
  - SOLD some **CASH** for **CRM**
    - I'm planning on buying more **CRM** and perhaps even some **NOW** the thought there is that they are oversold and undervalued basically out of fear like what happened last year with **AMD** and **GOOG** which turned out to be fantastic BUYs from me yesterday. I'll do it in batches like last year
  - Finished off with a small BUY of **HHIS** the day before the ex-dividend date

So the wildest thing this month for me was the sale of **HYLD** which is something I've debated for awhile. Lately I've been thinking about moving away from the majority of my covered calls. Doing something like:
  - **HDIV** -> **VDY**
  - **QQCL** -> **HXQ**

This would leave me with **HHIS** and **BANK** only for covered calls which I'm good with. My prediction for the next few months is either flat or decrease overall which is supposed to be ideal for CC ETFs. If we get a big decrease I will likely switch out at that point so I can hopefully capture all of the upside coming out of it.

### RRSP Buys
Honestly we couldn't decide what to buy in the spousal RRSP, BANK has been killing it and is by far the best performer since we opened the spousal almost one year ago so we bought some of all 3. My RRSP didn't see any action this month other than a nice fractional VDY DRIP

- BUY
  - **VFV** 2:4
  - **QQCL** 1:4
  - **BANK** 1:4

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
- **VDY** First month since September with a distribution in the $0.20 range 🤞
- **CASH** 0.097 -> 0.071 Tough to see this **1.7%** given my HISA is **2.25%**
  - **PSA** is doing better at **2.1%** currently (my wife has some joint money in that ETF in her TFSA) 
  - may have to slowly transition out of CASH throughout the year as I earn money to replace it with in the HISA. My goal is to not take any withdrawals out of my TFSA moving forward.

## Fear and Greed Index
A bit of a change up from last month as we have dipped from the bottom of greed through neutral and landed just in the fear territory. Definitely some uncertainty now with the SAAS-mageddon we have going on paired with all of the hyper-scalers devoting basically their entire cash flow to capital expenditure on chips this year. I'm talking Google, Amazon and Meta although there are likely others in the same position.

## Wrap Up
February turned out to be just as wild as January for us this year. Globally there was more military action from the USA as well so we'll have to see what affect that has on the market's tomorrow. Good news is that we have some cash and CASH to deploy still. Just before I sign off I have to mention it is now tax season and I believe I finally have all of my forms to file our taxes. Translation should have even more funds to deploy in a week or so. Speaking of which I better get at it. That's all for this week, take care!
