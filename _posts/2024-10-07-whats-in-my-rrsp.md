## Starting Out
Like most people my first foray into opening an RRSP to save for retirement took the form of a mutual fund. Unfortunately that mutual fund did not seem to perform well and I simply let it ride for many years until I eventually pulled it out under the First Time Home Buyers plan when purchasing our home in 2021.

## DIY
My first step into DYI investing was through a Robo-advisor under a TFSA account type. I started out with an 8 out of 10 risk rating for a few months before I learned during my 20s was the time to go as equity heavy as possible. In Robo-advisor terms that meant to up the risk rating to 10 out of 10. Side note most robo-advisor offerings have the ability to go 100% equities if you reach out to support (typically the 10 out of 10 risk tolerance rating still leaves you  with some bonds / gold / treasuries).

Approximately 6 months after opening the robo TFSA and being un-impressed by the performance of my mutual fund based RRSP I decided to pick a few stocks. The tickers I started with were:

## Pre House
Fast forward into the future I am now in a steady relationship (with my now wife) and the year is 2020, specifically Februrary of 2020. The news is all doom and gloom and both the Canadian and American governments are talking about shutting the country down. People are hogging toilet paper and canned goods. I am just about to be out of probation at my new job and living in a spacious 2 bedroom with a great friend all in for about $1300 a month. Little did I know that in a few short weeks my portfollio would plumit with the stock market crash of February 20, 2020.

At first I was shocked but after the initial shock hit I thought to myself this is what happens sometimes and this currently has little to no effect as you are investing for the future. Being tax season I submitted mine and a few weeks later received a sizeable amount which I invested in two chunks mid March. Unfortunately the markets continued to drop until April 7th 2020. But hey time in the market beats timing the market, right?

Although my nice lump sum had already been deployed and continued to drop I stuck with the plan and dollar cost averaged with every pay cheque. Little did I know that a mere 6 months later the markets would rally an incredible [INSERT AMOUNT HERE]. I didn't know it at the time, but, that wasn't going to be the biggest change in my life during that time.

In August of 2020 my partner and I decided to take the next step in our relationship and I moved into her 650 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. She had been living there for a few years prior to us meeting and due to this our rent, in the city of Toronto, was an astonishly low $1450 + electricity. We were splitting everything 50:50 so my portion was $750. I didn't know it at the time but this was the start of the second leg of my financial journey.

Socially the world is in a weird place, some things are still locked down, you are supposed to stay within the a defined social circle and if you look at any social media people with careers unaffected by the lockdowns are thriving and the hospitality and travel industries are struggling. Luckily I fell into the former category and I have been able to secure a decent sized raise a work. The increased salary paired with the lower living expenses has my savings rate around 70%. At this point I finally felt that I had made it and I was rocketing closer to the [first of 5 steps to financial freedom](/_posts/2024-09-30-5-steps-to-financial-freedom.md)

In the spring of 2021 we made the decision to move out of our apartment into a place that we would buy and thus the great hunt began. I won't go through all the details but we saw over 60 units. These units were all over the Greater Toronto Area, only condition being "close" to downtown for work. We made five bids were laughed at for two of them and ended up having to increase our final bid by $10,000 even though we were already the highest bid.

## Post House
We moved into our new place at the end of May 2021 with a mortgage locked in for 3 years @1.78%. We were estatic our savings accounts were not. Both of our savings accounts were nearly wiped out and we had maybe 2 months of emergency fund left. Financailly speaking if everything stayed the same we would be fine first topping up the emergency fund and then re-building the investments accounts.

Personally I was excited for the rebuild. My dog of a Mutual fund RRSP had been cleared and closed in favour of self directed accounts. I also decided I was confident enough in my knowledge to close the robo-advisor and take my TFSA to be purely DIY / self directed as well. Main reason behind this is I could simply buy what it bought in the same ratios and save the 0.5% management fee.

Part of the reason I was so excited to be rebuilding was my discovery of the FIRE movement and t
## Today

Present day I have chosen to take a nice streamlined dollar cost averaging approach to my retirement savings. My current holdings are split into straight indices and blue chip dividend payors. The tickers are:
  - VDY.TO
  - XAW.TO
  - SCHD
  - VTI

My work RRSP with matching is in a Robo-Advisor 90% equities 10% gold and fixed income. This is my smallest account by far as I only add enough to take full advantage of the
