## Major Indices VS My RRSP

October is here and its almost thanksgiving here in Canada. I am definitely thankful for sticking to my investment thesis this year and believing in dollar cost averaging. Complaint wise SCHD is still lagging hard but, hey you cant win them all. Otherwise September was up up up and the US government shutdown does not appear to be affecting the market.

## My Moves
Another simple month for me here in September with a few purchases in the TFSA and being a heavy RRSP dividend month I came back to my RRSP instead of the spousal this month. Let's dive in

### TFSA Buys & Sells
  - Bought
    - **AMD** with dividends
    - **HXQ** with dividends as well
    - **VFV** with the normal contribution

### TFSA Breakdown

### RRSP Buys
With all the dividends this month particularly from **SHCD** and **VTI** this month I decided to pickup a relatively large amount of **VTI** this month. Was a little nerve racking at all time highs, but, as mentioned earlier dollar cost averaging is still the name of my game. This makes VTI over 50% of my RRSP for the first time. Will likely average into other holdings for the rest of the year.

- Bought
  - **VTI** with a combination of divid

### Dividend Increases and Decreases
None of my static dividend payors have dividend changes but in general the fluxtuating ones like **VDY**, **SCHD**, **VTI** and more are higher than they were last year so that's great to see in the dividend growth front.

**CASH** was stagnant at **$0.106** for the past 4 and this month it is slightly decreased to **$0.10** which is too be expected as interest rates have likely dipped with both the BoC and the FED reducing their overnight interest rate by 0.25% mid month.

## Fear and Greed Index
Not much change here over the last month. Still sitting on the high end of neutral with the odd bounce into greedy territory over the month.

## Wrap Up
So it appears that the markets liked the small rate cuts but aren't worried about a recession or the upcoming US government shut down. September like August was another month of up up up. Surely this can't also be the case for October, can it?

Only time will tell. That's all for this months review thank you for reading!
